            <h2>Continually Learning Agents</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Our primary research focus is building agents that can learn and improve continuously throughout their lifetime.</p>

            <div class="research-detail">
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>Traditional AI systems are static after training. They cannot adapt to new situations, learn from mistakes, or improve based on experience. We're working to change that by developing agents that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn from every interaction and experience</li>
                    <li>Adapt their behavior based on feedback and outcomes</li>
                    <li>Transfer knowledge across different tasks and domains</li>
                    <li>Improve their performance over extended periods of operation</li>
                    <li>Operate autonomously with minimal human intervention</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="research-detail">
                <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                <p>We're combining multiple research directions to achieve continual learning:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Online Learning:</strong> Updating models in real-time from streaming data</li>
                    <li><strong>Meta-Learning:</strong> Teaching agents how to learn efficiently</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Systems:</strong> Developing architectures that maintain and utilize long-term knowledge</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Adapting to individual users and contexts</li>
                    <li><strong>Robust Reasoning:</strong> Building reliable decision-making under uncertainty</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

            <h2>Research Areas</h2>
            <div class="research-grid">
                <div class="research-item">
                    <h3>Meta-Learning</h3>
                    <p>Enabling models to learn how to learn, adapting quickly to new tasks and domains. This is fundamental to building agents that can continuously acquire new skills and knowledge efficiently.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="research-item">
                    <h3>Reasoning & Inference</h3>
                    <p>Developing advanced reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning. Agents need robust reasoning to make decisions and learn from complex environments.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="research-item">
                    <h3>Self-Aware Systems</h3>
                    <p>Building models with calibrated confidence and uncertainty quantification. Continual learning requires knowing what you know and what you need to learn.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="research-item">
                    <h3>Efficient Learning</h3>
                    <p>Developing scalable and cost-effective training methods for advanced AI systems. Continual learning must be practical and sustainable for real-world deployment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="research-item">
                    <h3>Personalization</h3>
                    <p>Creating systems that adapt to individual users and contexts. Personalization is a key capability for agents that learn continuously in diverse environments.</p>
