            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>SapientPriors is working towards creating completely autonomous agents that can learn continuously from their environment, adapt to new challenges, and improve over time without human intervention.</p>
            <p>We believe the path to truly intelligent systems requires agents that can:</p>
            <ul class="vision-list">
                <li>Learn from experience in real-world environments</li>
                <li>Adapt to changing conditions and requirements</li>
                <li>Improve their performance continuously</li>
                <li>Operate autonomously without constant human supervision</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personalization as a Service</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Our first step towards autonomous continually learning agents</p>
            <div class="personalization-content">
                <p>We're currently focused on personalization as a critical puzzle piece in building continually learning agents. Our Personalization as a Service platform enables AI systems to:</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Learn individual user preferences</strong> - Adapt to unique patterns and needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Evolve over time</strong> - Continuously refine understanding through interactions</li>
                    <li><strong>Generalize across contexts</strong> - Apply learned preferences intelligently</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain privacy</strong> - Learn without compromising user data</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This foundation in personalization is teaching us how to build systems that truly learn and adapt, bringing us closer to our vision of fully autonomous continually learning agents.</p>

            <h2>The Product: Continuous Learning API</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Transform your LLM application into a continuously learning agent</p>

            <div class="problem-solution">
                <div class="problem-box">
                    <h3>The Problem with Current LLMs</h3>
                    <p>Today's LLM applications don't learn from users over time. Every conversation starts from scratch:</p>
                    <ul class="example-list">
                        <li><strong>Email Assistant:</strong> You tell it to "keep emails concise" today, but tomorrow it forgets and writes long emails again</li>
                        <li><strong>Code Helper:</strong> You prefer TypeScript with functional patterns, but it keeps suggesting class-based JavaScript</li>
                        <li><strong>Writing Tool:</strong> You've corrected the same formatting preferences 10 times, yet it still doesn't remember your style</li>
                        <li><strong>Shopping Assistant:</strong> You're vegetarian and mention it repeatedly, but it continues recommending meat products</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="insight">The model has no memory of your preferences, corrections, or interaction history. Each session is isolated.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="solution-box">
                    <h3>The Solution: Integrate Our API</h3>
                    <p>By integrating our Continuous Learning API, your application becomes an agent that truly learns:</p>
                    <ul class="example-list">
                        <li><strong>Email Assistant:</strong> After a few interactions, it automatically writes concise emails matching your tone and style</li>
                        <li><strong>Code Helper:</strong> Learns you prefer TypeScript with functional patterns and consistently applies this knowledge</li>
                        <li><strong>Writing Tool:</strong> Remembers all formatting preferences and applies them automatically to new content</li>
                        <li><strong>Shopping Assistant:</strong> Understands your dietary restrictions and proactively filters recommendations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="insight">Your agent continuously improves, becoming more personalized and effective with every interaction.</p>

            <div class="api-benefits">
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>Simple API integration that adds continuous learning to any LLM application:</p>
                <ol class="integration-steps">
                    <li>Send user interactions to our API</li>
                    <li>Our system learns patterns and preferences over time</li>
                    <li>Retrieve personalized context for each user session</li>
                    <li>Your LLM uses this context to provide personalized responses</li>
                </ol>
