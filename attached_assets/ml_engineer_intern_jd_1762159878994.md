# Machine Learning Engineer Intern

## About Sapient Priors

We're building the future of AI agents that truly learn. At Sapient Priors, we're working towards completely autonomous agents that learn continuously from their environment, adapt to new challenges, and improve over time without human intervention. Our first step is building Personalization as a Service - a Continuous Learning API that transforms static LLM applications into agents that learn and improve with every interaction.

Our team includes ML veterans with 12+ years of experience from Microsoft, Twitter, and Dropbox, alongside product management leaders from Uber and Amazon. We're creating foundational infrastructure that enables AI systems to break free from the limitations of static models and deliver experiences that get better over time.

## The Role

We're seeking a talented and motivated ML Engineer Intern who's excited to own features end-to-end in our continual learning infrastructure. This isn't your typical internship where you'll be relegated to side projects – you'll be building core features with complete ownership from ideation to production. You'll work on evaluation systems, personalization algorithms, memory architectures, and the API infrastructure that powers continuous learning for LLM applications.

### Key Responsibilities

**Continuous Learning Systems**
* Build and own features for our Continuous Learning API that enables LLM applications to learn from user interactions
* Develop personalization algorithms that extract and apply user preferences across sessions
* Implement memory architectures for maintaining and retrieving learned patterns over time
* Design APIs and interfaces for integrating continuous learning into LLM applications
* Build context management systems that evolve user understanding through interactions

**Evaluation & Testing Infrastructure**
* Design and implement comprehensive evaluation pipelines for measuring learning effectiveness
* Build robust test suites including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
* Create benchmarks for personalization accuracy and preference learning metrics
* Develop automated systems for continuous evaluation of learning algorithms
* Run A/B experiments to validate improvements in personalization quality

**Production Engineering**
* Deploy features to production with proper monitoring and observability
* Build reliable and scalable services for real-time learning and inference
* Implement logging and debugging tools for production learning systems
* Ensure high availability and performance of the Continuous Learning API
* Create documentation and runbooks for your services

## Required Qualifications

* Currently pursuing or recently completed a degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or related field
* Strong programming skills in Python
* Understanding of software engineering best practices (version control, testing, code review)
* Ability to work independently and own projects end-to-end
* Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills
* Genuine excitement about building AI systems that learn continuously

## Nice to Have

* Experience with reinforcement learning or online learning systems
* Familiarity with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar LLM frameworks
* Experience with vector databases and embedding systems (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)
* Knowledge of personalization or recommendation systems
* Understanding of few-shot learning, meta-learning, or continual learning research
* Experience with production ML systems and monitoring
* Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
* Prior experience with testing ML systems
* Contributions to open-source ML projects

## What You'll Learn

* How to build production-ready continual learning systems from scratch
* State-of-the-art techniques for personalization and adaptive AI
* Memory architectures that enable agents to learn across sessions
* Best practices for testing and evaluating learning algorithms
* End-to-end product development with high ownership and autonomy
* API design for ML infrastructure used by other developers
* Working at the cutting edge of continual learning and agent research
* Startup experience with direct impact on foundational AI technology

## Internship Details

* **Duration:** 6-12 months
* **Location:** Bangalore-based (Hybrid/Flexible work arrangements)
* **Start Date:** Flexible
* **Compensation:** Competitive stipend
* **Perks:** Potential for full-time conversion based on performance and company needs

## Why Join Sapient Priors?

* **Work on foundational AI infrastructure** that enables the next generation of intelligent agents
* **Own significant features** from conception to production deployment
* **Learn directly** from ML veterans with 12+ years of experience at Microsoft, Twitter, and Dropbox
* **High autonomy and responsibility** from day one - this is real engineering work, not busywork
* **Be part of early-stage startup** building technology at the frontier of continual learning research
* **Direct mentorship** from engineers who've scaled ML systems at top tech companies
* **Shape the future** of how AI systems learn and adapt in the real world

## Our Commitment to Diversity

We are an equal opportunity employer committed to building a diverse and inclusive team. We believe diverse perspectives make our technology and company stronger.
