# Machine Learning Engineer (Full-Time)

## About Sapient Priors

We're building the future of AI agents that truly learn. At Sapient Priors, we're working towards completely autonomous agents that learn continuously from their environment, adapt to new challenges, and improve over time without human intervention. Our mission is to create foundational infrastructure that bridges the gap between static LLMs and truly intelligent, adaptive systems.

Our first product, Personalization as a Service, is a Continuous Learning API that transforms static LLM applications into agents that learn and improve with every user interaction. We're solving one of the fundamental challenges in AI: enabling systems to learn from experience in real-world environments while maintaining privacy and reliability at scale.

Our founding team includes ML veterans with 12+ years of experience from Microsoft, Twitter, and Dropbox, alongside product management leaders from Uber and Amazon. We're backed by strong investors and are building technology at the frontier of continual learning research.

## The Role

We're seeking an exceptional Machine Learning Engineer to join our founding engineering team. You'll have significant ownership over core systems that power continuous learning for AI agents. This role combines cutting-edge ML research implementation with production engineering - you'll be architecting learning algorithms, building scalable infrastructure, and shipping features that directly enable AI systems to become more intelligent over time.

This is a high-impact role where your work will define how thousands of AI applications learn and adapt. You'll work closely with founders who've built ML systems at scale and have the autonomy to drive technical decisions from research to production.

### Key Responsibilities

**Continual Learning Infrastructure**
* Architect and implement core learning algorithms that enable AI agents to improve from interactions
* Design and build scalable personalization systems that adapt to individual user patterns
* Develop novel memory architectures for knowledge retention and retrieval across sessions
* Research and implement state-of-the-art continual learning techniques from recent papers
* Build systems that balance learning new information with preserving existing knowledge (solving catastrophic forgetting)

**Production ML Systems**
* Design and deploy the Continuous Learning API used by production LLM applications
* Build scalable inference and learning pipelines that handle millions of interactions
* Implement robust data pipelines for processing user interactions and extracting learning signals
* Create monitoring and observability systems for production learning algorithms
* Ensure high availability, low latency, and reliability of ML services at scale

**Evaluation & Research**
* Design comprehensive evaluation frameworks for measuring continual learning effectiveness
* Build automated testing and benchmarking systems for learning algorithms
* Conduct experiments to validate improvements in personalization and adaptation
* Stay current with continual learning, meta-learning, and online learning research
* Contribute to research initiatives and potentially publish findings

**Technical Leadership**
* Drive technical architecture decisions for learning systems and infrastructure
* Establish engineering best practices for ML development, testing, and deployment
* Mentor junior engineers and interns on the team
* Collaborate with founders on product strategy and technical roadmap
* Own features end-to-end from ideation through production deployment

## Required Qualifications

* **Strong ML fundamentals:** Deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, optimization, and statistical learning theory

* **End-to-end ownership:** Track record of shipping ML features from research to production
* **Learning orientation:** Demonstrated ability to quickly learn and implement new research techniques
* **Communication skills:** Excellent written and verbal communication for technical and non-technical audiences

## Strongly Preferred Qualifications

* Experience with continual learning, online learning, meta-learning, or few-shot learning systems
* Deep understanding of LLM architectures, fine-tuning, and inference optimization
* Experience building personalization or recommendation systems at scale
* Familiarity with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or related techniques
* Experience with vector databases, embeddings, and semantic search systems
* Strong background in distributed systems and cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure)
* Publications or contributions to ML research
* Experience at early-stage startups or high-autonomy environments
* Open-source contributions to ML projects

## Technical Stack (Evolving)

* **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace Transformers
